  <h2>Larken Farms began in 2000 as a hobby for Ken & Laura Jo Halverson to try out their "green thumb" at growing peaches. What started as a hobby has now turned into a full time orchard!</h2>
  <br>
  <h2>Larken Farms has over 10,000 trees with 30 varieties of Texas and California peaches, Santa Rosa plums, Hosul Asian pears, and several hundred blackberry bushes.</h2>
  <br>
  <h2>We also have a garden which produces a variety of home-grown vegetables.</h2>
  <br>
  <h2>While we are not "certified" as organic growers, we practice organic methods for growing all of our fruits and vegetables.</h2>
  <br>
  <h2>Feel free to give us a call at (972) 938-7150 between the hours of 9AM - 5PM Monday - Friday or send us an email at khalver439@aol.com for more information. Thanks for looking us up!</h2>
