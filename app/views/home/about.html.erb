  <h2>Larken Farms began in 2000 as a hobby for Ken & Laura Jo Halverson to try out their "green thumb" at growing peaches. What started as a hobby has now turned into a full time orchard!</h2>
  <br>
  <h2>Larken Farms has over 10,000 trees with 30 varieties of Texas and California peaches, Santa Rosa plums, Hosul Asian pears, several hundred blackberry bushes, and more.</h2>
  <br>
  <h2>We also have a garden which produces a variety of home-grown vegetables.</h2>
  <br>
  <h2>While we are not "certified" as organic growers, we practice organic methods for growing all of our fruits and vegetables.</h2>
